Here is a bunch of stuff we find useful, especially if you're coming from a non-Mac background.
Yes, some of it costs money (has $ sign in the title). Ask your boss.

## [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) $

It's much better than the built-in launcher of spotlight search. It's very fast, and is pluggable into many other apps on your Mac.

It's a windows manager. Lets you do stuff like Maximize window, organize windows to fill screen, move between screens, etc.

Strong keyboard bindinds.
